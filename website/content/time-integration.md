# Time integration and leapfrog

Spatial reconstruction and time integration are independent choices. After spatial discretization, a PDE becomes an ODE system dU/dt = L(U). Accuracy, stability, monotonicity, dissipation, and cost then depend on both parts. The [time integration notebook](https://koyamarium.github.io/the-art-of-numerical-algorithms/#/time-integration) isolates the temporal choice using y′ = i y, y(0) = 1.

## Twelve methods on one oscillator

The exact solution exp(i t) follows the unit circle. Forward Euler and backward Euler are first order: the former grows on this undamped oscillator, while the latter damps it. The explicit RK2 family includes Heun / SSPRK(2,2), explicit midpoint, and Ralston. Kutta RK3, SSPRK(3,3), and SSPRK(4,3) are third order; classical RK4 and SSPRK(5,4) are fourth order. Implicit midpoint is second order and preserves the amplitude of this linear oscillator. Its phase still has error. Read the [RK family chapter](runge-kutta.md) and use the [family notebook](https://koyamarium.github.io/the-art-of-numerical-algorithms/#/runge-kutta) for stage/order/SSP comparisons and nonlinear tests.

For y′ = lambda y, define z = lambda delta t. One-step amplification factors include

\[
R_{\rm FE}=1+z,\quad R_{\rm BE}=\frac1{1-z},\quad
R_{\rm midpoint}=\frac{1+z/2}{1-z/2}.
\]

The RK factors are the exponential Taylor polynomial through degree two, three, or four for the three RK2 variants, Kutta RK3 / SSPRK(3,3), or classical RK4 on this scalar linear equation. SSPRK(4,3) instead has a degree-four term z⁴/48; SSPRK(5,4) has an additional degree-five term. Shared scalar amplification does not make nonlinear RK stages identical. SSP properties depend on a forward-Euler bound for the spatial operator; they are not unconditional stability.

## Leapfrog needs two roots

The centered, two-step first-order-system recurrence is

\[
y^{n+1}=y^{n-1}+2z y^n,\qquad
\xi_\pm=z\pm\sqrt{1+z^2}.
\]

The root tending to +1 as z tends to zero carries the physical mode; the root tending to −1 carries a computational mode alternating between steps. Both roots and their multiplicities matter. For z = i sigma, distinct roots have unit modulus when |sigma| < 1. At |sigma| = 1 the repeated root can give linearly growing solutions; do not include that endpoint in a general boundedness claim. Above it, one root grows geometrically.

A starting value is required in addition to y(0). This implementation takes one RK4 step, optionally adding a real perturbation epsilon to y(1). At lambda = 0 that perturbation gives even samples equal to 1 and odd samples equal to 1+epsilon: a direct computational-mode demonstration. For the notebook’s oscillator it also perturbs the physical mode.

Time filters such as the Robert–Asselin family modify this behavior, with their own damping and accuracy tradeoffs; see [Williams (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1175/2009MWR2724.1). No filter is applied in this edition.

## Particle leapfrog is a different formulation

A staggered kick–drift scheme for position and velocity, or velocity Verlet for a second-order mechanical system, is often also called leapfrog. Its variables live at different temporal locations and its symplectic interpretation uses that structure. The scalar recurrence above is not a demonstration of a complete SPH particle integrator or a proof of long-time energy conservation for general mechanics.

## Reproduce and read the notebook

```python
from numart.time_integration import linear_trajectory, leapfrog_roots
t, y = linear_trajectory(rate=1j, dt=0.1, steps=200, method='leapfrog')
print(leapfrog_roots(0.1j))
```

The browser selects from Python-computed trajectories with fixed final time 20, twelve methods, seven step sizes, and three leapfrog starting perturbations. Axes expand for unstable samples. A matching time interval is not an equal-cost comparison: implicit solves and RK stages differ. Tests measure temporal refinement orders and check the leapfrog roots, alternating mode, and midpoint amplitude. These oscillator trajectories evaluate the scalar stability factor, which is algebraically equivalent to RK stages on this linear test equation; the separate family notebook evaluates full nonlinear stages.

## Canonical mechanical maps

The [symplectic integration chapter](symplectic.md) now implements mechanical kick–drift–kick Verlet, a fourth-order Yoshida composition, symplectic Euler, and implicit midpoint on harmonic and quartic Hamiltonians. The [map notebook](https://koyamarium.github.io/the-art-of-numerical-algorithms/#/hamiltonian) compares them with RK4, separating canonical structure from exact energy conservation.
